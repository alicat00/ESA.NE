                                    <h1>MISSION STATEMENT</h1>
                                    <p>East and Southeast Asians North East is a not-for-profit grassroots organisation
                                        whose goal is to address structural racism and inequalities affecting ESA people,
                                        as well as to build our community and promote collective healing
                                        and identity in the North East of England.</p>
                                    <h3>'Addressing structural racism and inequalities'</h3>
                                    <p>means holding institutions accountable for their attitudes and responsibility to protecting
                                        people who have experienced hate crimes and structural racism, as well as mobilising
                                        people to campaign against hate towards ESA people in the UK, and specifically the North East of England.
                                        Additionally, we are working to dismantle stereotypes about ESA people that are damaging to our communities.
                                        Indeed, ESA.NE was founded in direct response to myths and hate
                                        crimes about ESA people in the context of the Coronavirus Pandemic.</p>
                                    <h4>‘Build our community’</h4>
                                    <p>means making spaces for community to exist, and bringing people together to celebrate
                                        our ESA joys in addition to addressing structural racism and inequalities. Activists who
                                        work together, should play together- otherwise what is it all for? For our community to
                                        come together, we are constantly learning and unlearning so that we can be as inclusive
                                        and accessible as possible, and we ask that our members commit to this work as well.</p>
                                    <h5>‘Promote collective healing and identity’</h5>
                                    <p>means recognising the traumas and experiences that we have as ESA individuals. We are not
                                        a monolith, and each of us has our own stories and experiences, but we all experience
                                        mental and physical health. By recognising the traumas and experiences that we have
                                        as ESA individuals, we can meet people where they are at, and offer peer support to
                                        one another to promote individual wellbeing. Anti-racist organising is imperative work
                                        but demands a lot of emotional labour from the individuals affected by structural
                                        racism and inequalities the most. Burnout and Re-traumatisation are serious risks so
                                        meeting people where they are at and offering peer support is
                                        really important to manage these risks.</p>
